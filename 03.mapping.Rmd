# Build a mask for permanent water and associated mixels
```{r build a mask}
# Select all cells that represent permanent water
## threshold = 360 days
hydro.360 = reclassify (hydroperiod.93, # the raster to be reclassified
                        matrix(c(0, 360, NA), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE))

# Delete all permanent water lying inside our presence lagoon
## There must be few but still we can have some artifacts


# Draw a buffer of 40m (= 2 pixels) at the limit of permanent water
## S4 method for signature 'RasterLayer'
hydro.buf = buffer(hydro.360, 
                   width=30, # numeric, include just more than one pixel
                   doEdge = TRUE) # logical, the boundaries function is called first
